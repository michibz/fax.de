XML-Soap Interface PC-FAX.com
Introduction
The described interface is based on a SOAP protocol (Simple Object Access Protocol) and
supplies a Web Service. At this juncture, XML formatted enquiries are transferred to the FAX.de
server with the aim of forwarding fax documents, SMS or iLetter (post letters)
To keep the interface as simple as possible, we strongly reduced the entries. With these entries,
services from all kinds of web or office applications can be activated very fast and efficiently.
The CCE entries 4-10 are services that can be used to secure a convenient web application.
1. Register (registration of user data/changes of user data)
2. CCE_SendASP (to send fax, SMS, iLetter or email)
3. CCE_Status (enquiry about the processing status, report)
4. CCE_KundenName (to provide client name)
5. CCE_KundenDaten (to provide client data)
6. CCE_KontoStand (to provide balance of accounts)
7. CCE_Journal (to provide accounting journal)
8. CCE_MyAccountASP (to provide account master data)
9. CCE_SendWelcomeMail (to transfer personal data via mail)
10. CCE_SetPasswordASP (to enter new password)
Configuration of the single types of entries and their response will be demonstrated below.
You will find a detailed documentation of an XML entry (configuration of a WSDL structure)
under http://ccs.fax.de/xmlws3.exe

Int CCE_Status (ByVal Account AS String,_

ByVal JobId As Long,_
ByVal Protokoll As Variant)
With this entry a single delivery will be provided with information. This is only possible if a
JobID was attached or recorded as identification with the delivery (CCE_SendASP).
The data set entry, which is related to the JobId, will be returned. In case of bulk mailing, a
number of data set entries related to the order number (in JobID transferred) may emerge.
The data set entries are passed in form of a list (items are separated by comma), where the
first line implies the configuration of the data set entry in terms of Token.
